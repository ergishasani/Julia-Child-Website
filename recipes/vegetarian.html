            <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>1 can of Apricots (halves)</li>
                <li>1Half a cup of refined sugar</li>
                <li>A couple drops of Almond extract</li>
                <li>2 T fresh lemon juice (</li>
                <li>2 medium egg whites</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions">
            <h1>Instructions</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Get a measuring cup (1 quart), and set aside. Get your apricots and start pureeing them until
                    smooth, and pour it
                    into the cup.</li>
                <li>ou have to make at least two quarts of pureed apricots for this recipe</li>
                <li>The next thing that you have to do, is combine the pureed apricots, lemon, and refined sugar into a
                    mixer. In high
                    speed, beat the mixture, until there are no signs of the refined sugar anymore.</li>
                <li>Once the refined sugar is fully dissolved, you can now add your almond extract, and the egg whites.
                    You can whip in
                    the egg whites using your mixer, but I definitely recommend using an ice cream
                    maker. It is easier and more efficient in making perfect sherbet. If you do not have an ice cream
                    maker, I heard
                    that some people use food processors, which produces the same outcome as well</li>
                <li>Once the egg whites are whipped in, pour your mixture into a clean container, and put it inside the
                    freezer.</li>
                <li>The tricky part here is – you have to check the sherbet after two hours of freezing. You have to
                    gently whip the
                    mixture again, in order to prevent the ice from building up. You have to do this twice,
                    or thrice, if you feel the need to do it</li>
                <li>Sherbet is not as solid as ice cream. It should have a consistency of a mousse. Before you serve the
                    apricot
                    sherbet, you have to whip once more, to achieve the kind of consistency that is perfect for a
                    sherbet.</li>
                <li>This is how easy Julia Child’s recipe is, for the apricot sherbet. It can be served with slices of
                    apricots on top,
                    or perhaps any type of fruit that you want that is available during the season.</li>
                <li>Any child or child at heart will enjoy eating apricot sherbet for dessert, a snack in between meals,
                    and also for a
                    perfect midnight snack</li>
                <li>This recipe is also good for those who are health conscious. Apricots are high in vitamins and
                    minerals that are
                    good for the body and your overall health.</li>
                <li>
